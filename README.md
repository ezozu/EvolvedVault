# EvolvedVault: A Secure and Adaptable Data Storage Solution

EvolvedVault is a sophisticated, type-safe data management system designed for scalability and flexibility. It addresses the growing need for secure and dynamically adaptable data storage solutions in modern application development. Built with TypeScript, it provides developers with a robust and reliable framework for managing sensitive information, user data, and application configurations. Its modular architecture allows for seamless integration with existing infrastructure and supports a wide range of data storage backends.

This project aims to provide a more refined and developer-friendly experience compared to traditional data vaults. EvolvedVault prioritizes ease of use without compromising on security. It incorporates advanced encryption techniques, role-based access control, and comprehensive auditing capabilities to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. The core design philosophy emphasizes extensibility, allowing developers to tailor the system to their specific requirements and integrate custom data storage solutions.

EvolvedVault is not just a data store; it's a comprehensive data management platform. It offers features such as automated data backups, version control, and data migration tools, making it a complete solution for managing the entire data lifecycle. The system is designed to be easily deployed and managed in various environments, from local development setups to large-scale cloud deployments. Its intuitive API and detailed documentation simplify integration and reduce the learning curve for new users.

## Key Features

*   **TypeScript Architecture:** Provides type safety, improved code maintainability, and enhanced developer experience. All core components are written in TypeScript, ensuring robust error handling and reduced runtime issues.
*   **Modular Design:** Allows for easy extension and customization with support for various data storage backends (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS S3). New storage adapters can be created without modifying the core functionality.
*   **Advanced Encryption:** Employs AES-256 encryption for data at rest and in transit, ensuring the highest level of security. Key management is handled separately to prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implements a granular RBAC system that allows administrators to define precise permissions for users and groups. This ensures that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.
*   **Audit Logging:** Tracks all data access and modification events, providing a comprehensive audit trail for security and compliance purposes. Logs can be exported in various formats for analysis.
*   **Data Versioning:** Maintains a history of data changes, allowing users to revert to previous versions if necessary. This is particularly useful for configuration management and data recovery.
*   **Data Migration Tools:** Provides tools for migrating data between different storage backends and versions, simplifying the process of upgrading and maintaining the system. The migration process is designed to be non-disruptive and minimize downtime.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** Primary programming language providing strong typing and modern language features. Used for all core components and APIs.
*   **Node.js:** Runtime environment for executing the TypeScript code. Provides a cross-platform environment for deployment.
*   **Express.js:** Web application framework for building the API endpoints and managing HTTP requests. Provides a robust and scalable foundation for the API.
*   **PostgreSQL (Optional):** Relational database for storing metadata and configuration data. Can be replaced with other databases as needed.
*   **MongoDB (Optional):** NoSQL database for storing unstructured data. Provides flexibility for handling different data formats.
*   **AWS S3 (Optional):** Cloud storage service for storing large files and backups. Offers scalability and cost-effectiveness.
*   **Jest:** Testing framework for unit and integration testing. Ensures code quality and reliability.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js (version 16 or higher) and npm (version 8 or higher) installed on your system.
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/ezozu/EvolvedVault.git
3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    cd EvolvedVault
4.  **Install dependencies:**
    npm install
5.  **Build the project:**
    npm run build
6.  **Configure the environment variables (see Configuration section below).**

## Configuration

The following environment variables need to be configured before running EvolvedVault:

*   `NODE_ENV`: The environment in which the application is running (e.g., `development`, `production`). Defaults to `development`.
*   `PORT`: The port on which the application will listen for incoming requests. Defaults to `3000`.
*   `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for the database. This is only required if using a database-backed storage adapter. Example: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`.
*   `ENCRYPTION_KEY`: A strong, randomly generated encryption key used to encrypt sensitive data. Ensure this key is securely stored and never exposed. A 32-character key is recommended.
*   `STORAGE_ADAPTER`: The storage adapter to use (e.g., `postgresql`, `mongodb`, `s3`). Defaults to `filesystem`.

These variables can be set in a `.env` file in the project root directory or as environment variables in your system.

## Usage

After installing and configuring EvolvedVault, you can start the server:

npm run start

This will start the server on the configured port. The API documentation will be available at `/api-docs` (e.g., http://localhost:3000/api-docs) once the server is running.

Example API endpoint (using a hypothetical API):

*   `POST /data/{key}`: Stores data associated with the given key. Request body should contain the data to be stored. Requires authentication with appropriate write permissions.
*   `GET /data/{key}`: Retrieves data associated with the given key. Requires authentication with appropriate read permissions.
*   `DELETE /data/{key}`: Deletes data associated with the given key. Requires authentication with appropriate delete permissions.

Detailed API documentation, including request and response formats, is available in the `/api-docs` section after the server is running.
